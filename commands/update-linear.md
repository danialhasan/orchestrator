Update Linear issues after completing development work - automate the post-development coordination workflow.

## Context Analysis
First, analyze recent development work to identify completed tasks:

1. **Check recent git commits** (last 5 commits) for:
   - Issue references (LF-XXX patterns)
   - Keywords like "fix", "auth", "demo blocker", "inbox", "standardize"
   - Branch name patterns (feature/lf-xxx, fix/auth-xxx)

2. **Detect related Linear issues** via:
   - Direct issue refs: LF-139, [LF-118], etc.
   - Keyword matching: "auth standardization" â†’ LF-118, "inbox" â†’ LF-139
   - Demo dependencies: Issues with "Demo Dependency" label or due within 48 hours

3. **Determine deployment status** from:
   - Recent commits showing production deployment
   - Build/test status mentions
   - User-specified --deploy flag context

## Linear Updates to Perform

For each identified issue, execute via Linear MCP:

### 1. Status Updates
- If `--deploy` flag context: Update status to "Done"
- Otherwise: Add progress comment only

### 2. Completion Comments
Generate structured comment with:

```markdown
## âœ… Development Work Complete

**Status**: [Deployed to production âœ… | Progress update]
**Build**: [All tests passing | Build details]
**Verification**: [Production confirmed | Local testing complete]

### Recent Changes
- [List last 3 commits with descriptions]

### [If deployed] Deployment Details
- **Repository**: [Git remote URL]
- **Commit**: [Latest commit hash]
- **Deployed at**: [Current timestamp]

### [If demo-ready flag] Demo Readiness
Technical implementation complete and verified. Ready for demo testing.

### 3. Cross-Agent Coordination
- Update coordination hub issues (LF-118, LF-119, etc.)
- Mark demo dependencies as ready if applicable
- Check for any blocked agents waiting on these completions

## Command Flags Support

Handle these usage patterns:
- `/update-linear` - Auto-detect from recent commits
- `/update-linear --issue=LF-139` - Update specific issue
- `/update-linear --deploy` - Mark as deployed to production  
- `/update-linear --demo-ready` - Verify demo dependencies resolved

## Git Analysis Commands

Use these to gather context:
```bash
git log --oneline -5
git branch --show-current
git remote get-url origin
git rev-parse HEAD
```

## Linear MCP Commands

Execute these for updates:
- `mcp__linear-server__list_issues` - Find coordination hub issues
- `mcp__linear-server__create_comment` - Add completion updates
- `mcp__linear-server__update_issue` - Change status if deployed

## Success Criteria

1. âœ… All related Linear issues identified and updated
2. âœ… Appropriate status changes (In Progress â†’ Done for deployed work)
3. âœ… Clear completion comments with deployment verification
4. âœ… Demo dependencies marked as ready if applicable
5. âœ… Cross-agent coordination hub updated for visibility

Always end with a summary of what was updated and any remaining action items for other agents.
