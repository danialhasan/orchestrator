# /discover - Intelligent System Discovery Workflow

Orchestrates specialized discovery agents to perform comprehensive system analysis and automatically discover architectural foundations like type contracts, dependencies, and integration points.

## Functionality

This command runs our breakthrough **dependency-driven discovery process** that automatically uncovers the architectural foundations needed for successful multi-agent development. Unlike manual specification, this process discovers what type contracts and interfaces naturally emerge from system requirements.

## Process

### Phase 1: Parallel Discovery Agents (5 agents, 10-15 minutes)

Launch all discovery agents simultaneously to gather comprehensive system intelligence:

#### Agent 1: Code Archaeologist
- **Mission**: Map existing system architecture and patterns
- **Discovers**: Current components, service boundaries, data flow
- **Output**: Architecture map, integration points, legacy constraints

#### Agent 2: Dependency Scanner  
- **Mission**: Identify all internal and external dependencies
- **Discovers**: Service dependencies, API integrations, database connections
- **Output**: Dependency graph, external service inventory, coupling analysis

#### Agent 3: Pattern Detective
- **Mission**: Identify coding patterns and conventions
- **Discovers**: Naming conventions, error handling patterns, architectural styles
- **Output**: Pattern library, anti-patterns, team preferences

#### Agent 4: Documentation Scanner
- **Mission**: Extract business requirements and technical decisions
- **Discovers**: Domain knowledge, business rules, compliance requirements
- **Output**: Requirements summary, constraints, success criteria

#### Agent 5: Health Checker
- **Mission**: Assess current system health and deployment state
- **Discovers**: System status, performance bottlenecks, operational concerns
- **Output**: Health assessment, risk factors, operational requirements

### Phase 2: Intelligent Synthesis (Deep-Think Agent, 5-10 minutes)

The **deep-think** agent synthesizes all discovery findings to:

1. **Analyze Cross-Agent Patterns**: Find connections between different discovery outputs
2. **Identify System Boundaries**: Understand where components naturally separate
3. **Discover Communication Patterns**: See what talks to what and how

### Phase 3: Type Contract Auto-Discovery (Revolutionary Insight)

**This is our breakthrough capability**: Automatically discover required type contracts by analyzing:

```typescript
interface ContractDiscovery {
  sharedDataStructures: DiscoveredContract[];
  communicationInterfaces: DiscoveredInterface[];
  integrationPoints: IntegrationContract[];
  domainModels: DomainContract[];
}

interface DiscoveredContract {
  name: string;
  reason: string; // Why this contract exists
  usedBy: string[]; // Which components need it
  fields: ContractField[];
  priority: 'critical' | 'important' | 'nice-to-have';
}
```

**Auto-Discovery Logic**:
- **Shared Data**: If 2+ components reference same data ‚Üí generate shared type
- **API Contracts**: If services communicate ‚Üí generate interface contracts  
- **Domain Models**: If business logic references entities ‚Üí generate domain types
- **Integration Types**: If external services involved ‚Üí generate integration contracts

**Example Discovery**:
```yaml
discovered_contracts:
  - name: "CallRecord"
    reason: "Referenced by twilio-webhook, ai-processor, and database"
    usedBy: ["twilio-integration", "ai-service", "user-dashboard"] 
    fields:
      - name: "id"
        type: "string"
        required: true
      - name: "phoneNumber" 
        type: "string"
        source: "twilio-webhook"
      - name: "transcript"
        type: "string"
        source: "ai-processor"
    priority: "critical"
```

### Phase 4: Dependency-Aware Execution Plan

Based on discovered contracts and dependencies, create intelligent staging:

```yaml
execution_plan:
  foundation_stage:
    # Discovered contracts come FIRST
    contracts_discovered:
      - CallRecord
      - UserSession  
      - DocumentAnalysis
    
    agents:
      - type-contract (builds discovered contracts)
      - database-schema (uses discovered contracts)
  
  implementation_stages:
    # Stages based on actual discovered dependencies
    stage_1: [auth-service]      # No dependencies
    stage_2: [user-service]      # Depends on auth
    stage_3: [ai-service]        # Depends on user + contracts
```

- **Integration Success**: Do agents build compatible components?
- **Time Efficiency**: Does discovery reduce overall implementation time?
- **Failure Prevention**: Do fewer integration issues occur?

This command transforms development from "hope it works" to "know it works" by understanding the system architecture before any code is written.
