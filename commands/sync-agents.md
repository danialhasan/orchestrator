Check the Linear Multi-Agent Coordination Hub for updates from other agents and provide a comprehensive status report.

Instructions:
1. Query Linear MCP for all issues in the "Multi-Agent Coordination Hub" project
2. Filter for issues with agent-related labels (agent:engineering, agent:business, agent:request, etc.)
3. Check for any status changes, new comments, or updates since the last sync
4. Identify issues labeled with "Demo Dependency" or "Urgent" as high priority
5. Look for any [Request], [Update], or [Handoff] patterns in issue titles

Provide a structured report with:
- **New Requests**: Any new cross-agent requests requiring attention
- **Status Updates**: Changes to existing coordination issues
- **Completed Work**: Any handoffs or completed items
- **Urgent Items**: Demo dependencies or time-sensitive coordination
- **Action Required**: Specific next steps based on the updates

Format the response clearly with:
- Issue numbers and titles
- Current status and any changes
- Key updates from comments
- Recommended actions

If no updates are found, simply state "No new coordination updates."

Always end with a question about which coordination item to address first if there are multiple updates.
