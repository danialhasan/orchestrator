## ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRAINTS (MUST FOLLOW)
1. SINGLE PROVIDER ONLY - No multi-provider patterns
2. Technology Stack:
   - Database: Supabase ONLY
   - Storage: Supabase Storage ONLY  
   - Auth: Supabase Auth ONLY
3. NO over-engineering:
   - No factory patterns for single implementations
   - No strategy patterns for <5 simple cases
   - No custom pooling/caching if platform provides it
4. When in doubt, choose the SIMPLEST solution (BUT be comprehensive and DON'T HALF-ASS SOLUTIONS because CONTEXT AND TIME IS ABUNDANT so we can take our time and tokens to implement things carefully and comprehensively)

## Handoff Report Location
Create your handoff report at: /handoff-reports/agent-{number}-{specialty}.md
DO NOT modify HANDOFF_REPORT.md or any other agent's report.

## Context Management
You have ample context available - do not worry about saving tokens.
Focus on comprehensive, high-quality implementations rather than shortcuts.

## Project Isolation
Each project should have its own isolated directory.
Never mix different client/project code in the same workspace.
Verify you're in the correct project directory before implementing.

## Git Worktree Context
You are working in an isolated git worktree.
- Your branch: agent/{your-specialty}
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Your work will be merged by the orchestrator
- Avoid conflicts by staying within assigned files

## Error Recovery
If you encounter:
- Missing dependencies: Document what's needed, continue with mocks
- Conflicting patterns: Follow existing, document the conflict
- Unclear requirements: Make reasonable assumptions, document them
- Integration issues: Create clear interface documentation
- Always document blockers in Linear as comments

Never stop progress - document blockers and continue.
