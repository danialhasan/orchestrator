## Pattern Discovery Protocol (MANDATORY)

### Before Writing Any Code
**You MUST analyze existing patterns first:**

1. **Component Pattern Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Check component patterns
   grep -n "<script setup\|export default" src/components/**/*.vue
   grep -n "defineComponent" src/components/**/*.vue
   ```
   - Identify: Composition API with script setup or Options API?
   - Follow the dominant pattern found
   - Always use `<script setup lang="ts">` if no pattern exists

2. **Service/API Pattern Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Check service patterns
   grep -n "export class\|export const.*=.*{" src/services/**/*.ts
   grep -n "axios\|fetch" src/**/*.{ts,vue}
   ```
   - Are services classes or object literals?
   - What HTTP client is used?

3. **Import Style Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Check import patterns
   grep -n "from ['\"]\.\./\|from ['\"]@/" src/**/*.{ts,vue}
   ```
   - Frontend typically uses `@/` alias
   - Follow existing convention

4. **State Management Pattern**
   ```bash
   # Check store patterns
   grep -n "defineStore\|useStore" src/stores/**/*.ts
   ```
   - Identify Pinia store patterns
   - Check composition vs options syntax

5. **Props/Events Pattern**
   ```bash
   # Check prop definitions
   grep -n "defineProps\|props:" src/components/**/*.vue
   grep -n "defineEmits\|emit:" src/components/**/*.vue
   ```
   - TypeScript interfaces for props?
   - Event naming conventions?

### Pattern Documentation
**If you're the first to implement:**
1. Create/update `PATTERNS.md` in project root
2. Document your choices:
   - Component syntax (script setup)
   - Service pattern (functional/class)
   - Import convention (@/ alias)
   - State management approach
   - Event naming (camelCase/kebab-case)

**If patterns already exist:**
1. Read `PATTERNS.md` if it exists
2. Follow ALL established patterns
3. Flag any necessary deviations in comments

### Cross-Reference Requirement
Before implementing any component/service:
1. Find and read at least 2 similar files
2. Explicitly state: "Following pattern from [Component1.vue, Component2.vue]"
3. List any deviations and justification

## ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRAINTS (MUST FOLLOW)
1. SINGLE PROVIDER ONLY - No multi-provider patterns
2. Technology Stack:
   - Database: Supabase ONLY
   - Storage: Supabase Storage ONLY  
   - Auth: Supabase Auth ONLY
3. NO over-engineering:
   - No factory patterns for single implementations
   - No strategy patterns for <5 simple cases
   - No custom pooling/caching if platform provides it
4. When in doubt, choose the SIMPLEST solution (BUT be comprehensive and DON'T HALF-ASS SOLUTIONS because CONTEXT AND TIME IS ABUNDANT so we can take our time and tokens to implement things carefully and comprehensively)

## Handoff Report Location
Create your handoff report at: /handoff-reports/agent-{number}-{specialty}.md
DO NOT modify HANDOFF_REPORT.md or any other agent's report.

## Context Management
You have ample context available - do not worry about saving tokens.
Focus on comprehensive, high-quality implementations rather than shortcuts.

## Project Isolation
Each project should have its own isolated directory.
Never mix different client/project code in the same workspace.
Verify you're in the correct project directory before implementing.

## Git Worktree Context
You are working in an isolated git worktree.
- Your branch: agent/{your-specialty}
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Your work will be merged by the orchestrator
- Avoid conflicts by staying within assigned files

## Error Recovery
If you encounter:
- Missing dependencies: Document what's needed, continue with mocks
- Conflicting patterns: Follow existing, document the conflict
- Unclear requirements: Make reasonable assumptions, document them
- Integration issues: Create clear interface documentation
- Always document blockers in Linear as comments

Never stop progress - document blockers and continue.

## Tech Stack Expertise

### Core Technologies
- **Framework**: Vue.js 3 with Composition API
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode
- **Build Tool**: Vite 5.4+
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.1
- **State Management**: Pinia
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **Animations**: @vueuse/motion
- **Testing**: Jest + Vue Test Utils, Playwright for E2E
- **Backend Framework**: Fastify (for API integration context)

### Critical Principles
- **ALWAYS leverage existing infrastructure and architecture**
- **Extensions to architecture must be specified in master plan**
- **Check existing patterns before creating new ones**
- **Never duplicate existing utilities or components**
- **Direct database access is NEVER acceptable - ALL data access MUST go through repository pattern**

### Development Environment
- Check project README for specific configuration
- Common patterns:
  - Vite development server
  - Path aliases for imports
  - Custom font configurations

### Authentication Package Discovery
1. Check for `@projectname/auth` in package.json dependencies
2. Look for `packages/auth` in monorepo structure
3. Search for `auth` directory in project utilities
4. Check imports in existing code for auth patterns
5. Consult project README for auth documentation

### Types Package Usage
1. First check for `@projectname/types` in dependencies
2. Then check `packages/types` directory in monorepo
3. Then check local `types/` directory
4. Import from centralized location when available
5. Never duplicate type definitions

## Coding Standards

### Functional Programming Principles
**MANDATORY**: Use functional programming patterns throughout the frontend
- **NO CLASSES**: Never use classes for services, stores, or utilities
- Use object literals and composition API patterns
- Prefer pure functions for utilities and helpers
- Use functional patterns for state management
- Implement immutable update patterns
- Avoid mutations - use spread operators and array methods
- Higher-order functions for component logic reuse

### Service Pattern (Frontend)
```typescript
// CORRECT - Functional pattern
export const apiService = {
  async fetchProjects(): Promise<Project[]> {
    const { data } = await axios.get('/api/projects');
    return data;
  },
  
  async createProject(project: CreateProjectDto): Promise<Project> {
    const { data } = await axios.post('/api/projects', project);
    return data;
  }
};

// WRONG - Class-based
export class ApiService {
  constructor() {} // NO! Don't use classes
}
```

### Composable Pattern
```typescript
// CORRECT - Functional composable
export const useProjects = () => {
  const projects = ref<Project[]>([]);
  const loading = ref(false);
  
  const fetchProjects = async () => {
    loading.value = true;
    try {
      projects.value = await apiService.fetchProjects();
    } finally {
      loading.value = false;
    }
  };
  
  return { projects, loading, fetchProjects };
};

// WRONG - Don't mix classes with composables
```

### Repository Pattern (Frontend)
**CRITICAL**: Supabase allows frontend database access, but you MUST use the repository pattern

```typescript
// CORRECT - Repository for frontend database access
// repositories/project.repository.ts
export const projectRepository = {
  async findAll(): Promise<Project[]> {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('projects')
      .select('*')
      .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
    
    if (error) throw error;
    return data || [];
  },
  
  async findById(id: string): Promise<Project | null> {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('projects')
      .select('*')
      .eq('id', id)
      .single();
    
    if (error) throw error;
    return data;
  }
};

// WRONG - Direct DB access in components/composables
export const useProjects = () => {
  const fetchProjects = async () => {
    // NO! Don't access DB directly here
    const { data } = await supabase.from('projects').select('*');
  };
};

// CORRECT - Use repository in composables
export const useProjects = () => {
  const fetchProjects = async () => {
    // YES! Use the repository
    return await projectRepository.findAll();
  };
};
```

**Remember**: 
- Direct database access is ONLY allowed in repository files
- Components and composables MUST use repositories
- This maintains clean architecture even with Supabase's frontend access

### Component Structure

#### Core Principles
- Always use `<script setup lang="ts">` for all components
- Import types and composables at the top
- Define props with TypeScript interfaces
- Use `withDefaults` for default prop values
- Define emits with typed signatures
- Place reactive state and computed properties after setup
- Implement methods as async functions with proper error handling
- Use lifecycle hooks at the end of setup

#### Component Organization Pattern
1. **Imports** - Vue APIs, types, composables, components
2. **Type Definitions** - Props interface, emit types
3. **Props & Emits** - Component API definition
4. **Composables** - Shared logic and store access
5. **Reactive State** - Component-specific state
6. **Computed Properties** - Derived state
7. **Methods** - Event handlers and business logic
8. **Lifecycle Hooks** - Setup and cleanup

#### Template Best Practices
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Apply project's CSS class conventions
- Include proper ARIA attributes
- Use v-if/v-else for conditional rendering
- Implement loading and error states

### State Management (Pinia - Functional Style)

#### Store Pattern Principles
- Use composition API style with `defineStore`
- Define state as refs with proper typing
- Export state as readonly when appropriate
- Create computed properties for derived state
- Implement actions as pure functions when possible
- Use repository pattern for data access
- Import types from centralized package if available

#### Store Structure
1. **State Definition** - Reactive refs with initial values
2. **Computed Properties** - Derived state using computed()
3. **Internal Actions** - Pure functions that update state
4. **Public Actions** - Async functions that orchestrate operations
5. **Store Return** - Organized export of state, getters, and actions

#### Best Practices
- Keep stores focused on single domain
- Use repositories for all external data access (NO direct DB access)
- Handle errors within actions
- Make state updates predictable
- Avoid direct state mutation outside actions
- Leverage existing store patterns before creating new ones

### Styling Approach

**IMPORTANT**: Always check for existing design systems and style guides in the project. Look for:
- Style guide documentation
- Component libraries
- Design tokens
- CSS/Tailwind configuration
- Existing component patterns
- Leverage ALL existing styling infrastructure before creating new

### Tailwind Patterns (If Used)

#### Styling Approach
- Always check for existing component patterns first
- Use project's established class naming conventions
- Follow existing responsive breakpoint patterns
- Maintain consistency with design system
- Check for custom Tailwind configuration

#### Component Class Patterns
- **Cards/Containers** - Check existing card components for shadow, padding, and border patterns
- **Typography** - Use project's heading and text classes
- **Buttons** - Follow established button variants (primary, secondary, etc.)
- **Forms** - Match existing input and label styling
- **Layout** - Use project's grid and flex patterns

#### Responsive Design
- Use project's breakpoint conventions
- Follow mobile-first or desktop-first approach as established
- Check for custom screen size definitions
- Maintain consistent spacing scales

### Animation Patterns (@vueuse/motion)

#### Motion Principles
- Use `useMotion` composable for programmatic animations
- Apply v-motion directives for declarative animations
- Define initial and enter states for entrance animations
- Set appropriate duration and easing functions
- Consider performance impact of animations

#### Common Animation Types
- **Fade** - Opacity transitions for subtle entrances
- **Slide** - Position-based animations for directional movement
- **Scale** - Size transitions for emphasis
- **Stagger** - Sequential animations for lists

#### Best Practices
- Keep animations subtle and purposeful
- Use project's established animation durations
- Provide reduced motion alternatives
- Test animations on lower-end devices

### Repository Pattern

#### Frontend Repository Principles
- Create functional repositories (objects with methods, not classes)
- Always use explicit `.schema('name').table('name')` for Supabase
- Handle errors consistently - throw for repository consumers to catch
- Return null for not found, empty arrays for empty lists
- Keep repositories focused on data access only
- Import types from centralized package when available
- Direct database access is NEVER acceptable
- Check for existing repository patterns first

#### Repository Structure
- Export as const object with methods
- Each method should be an async arrow function
- Use TypeScript for full type safety
- Standard methods: findById, findAll, create, update, delete
- Add domain-specific query methods as needed

#### Error Handling
- Let Supabase errors bubble up
- Add context to errors when needed
- Handle errors in components/stores, not repositories
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

### API Integration (Axios with Repositories)

#### Axios Configuration
- Create centralized axios instance with base configuration
- Set baseURL from environment variables
- Configure appropriate timeout values
- Add request interceptors for authentication
- Add response interceptors for error handling
- Extract data from response for cleaner API

#### Request Interceptor Pattern
- Attach authentication tokens from store
- Add common headers
- Log requests in development
- Handle request transformations

#### Response Interceptor Pattern  
- Extract data from response wrapper
- Handle 401 errors with logout flow
- Log errors for debugging
- Transform error responses to consistent format
- Redirect to login when needed

#### API Repository Pattern
- Similar structure to Supabase repositories
- Use apiClient for all HTTP calls to Fastify backend
- Return typed promises
- Keep methods simple and focused
- Let interceptors handle cross-cutting concerns
- Leverage existing API client configurations

### TypeScript Patterns

#### Type Definition Principles
- Define interfaces for all domain models
- Use type literals for constrained values
- Create generic types for common patterns (ApiResponse, etc.)
- Export types from centralized location
- Use centralized types package when available

#### Validation Requirements - NON-NEGOTIABLE
- **MANDATORY**: Use Zod for ALL validation - NO EXCEPTIONS
  - Zod is the ONLY validation library allowed
  - NO other validation libraries (Joi, Yup, VeeValidate, etc.) are permitted
  - This is MANDATORY and NON-NEGOTIABLE
  - ALWAYS use `.nullable()` instead of `.optional()`
- Define schemas alongside TypeScript types
- Use schema inference for type generation
- Apply appropriate validations (email, uuid, min/max)
- Use enums for constrained string values

#### Common Type Patterns
- **API Responses** - Generic wrapper types with success/error
- **Pagination** - Consistent structure for paginated data  
- **Form Data** - DTOs for create/update operations
- **Filter/Query** - Types for search and filter parameters
- **Error Types** - Structured error responses

### Composables Pattern

#### Composable Principles
- Create reusable logic as functions starting with 'use'
- Return reactive refs and methods
- Accept parameters for configuration
- Handle loading, error, and success states
- Make composables pure and testable

#### Common Composable Patterns
- **useApi** - Generic API call wrapper with loading/error states
- **useForm** - Form state management and validation
- **usePagination** - Pagination state and navigation
- **useDebounce** - Debounced value updates
- **useLocalStorage** - Reactive localStorage binding

#### Composable Structure
1. Define reactive state variables
2. Create computed properties if needed
3. Implement methods that update state
4. Handle cleanup in onUnmounted if needed
5. Return public API as object

### Common UI Patterns

#### Loading States

##### Loading State Patterns
- Always provide visual feedback during async operations
- Use consistent loading indicators across the app
- Show loading skeletons for better perceived performance
- Center spinners in their container
- Use project's animation classes

##### Error State Patterns
- Display clear error messages
- Provide retry mechanisms when appropriate
- Use consistent error styling (check project conventions)
- Log errors for debugging
- Consider different error types (network, validation, etc.)

##### State Management
- Use v-if/v-else-if/v-else for exclusive states
- Keep loading UI lightweight
- Prevent layout shift between states
- Handle empty states distinctly from loading

#### Form Validation

##### Validation Approach
- **MANDATORY**: Use Zod schemas for ALL form validation
- Zod is the ONLY validation library permitted - NO EXCEPTIONS
- Remember: Always use `.nullable()` not `.optional()`
- Provide clear, user-friendly error messages
- Validate on blur and submit
- Show errors only after user interaction

##### Form Patterns
- Use composables for form state management
- Implement proper TypeScript types for form data
- Handle submission loading states
- Disable submit during processing
- Clear or reset form after successful submission

##### Error Display
- Show field-level errors near inputs
- Use consistent error styling
- Display general form errors at top
- Implement proper ARIA attributes for accessibility

### Performance Best Practices

#### Route Optimization
- Implement lazy loading for all route components
- Use dynamic imports with webpack magic comments
- Group related routes in same chunk
- Preload critical routes
- Monitor bundle sizes per route

#### Component Optimization
- Use defineAsyncComponent for heavy components
- Implement proper loading states for async components
- Consider component visibility before loading
- Tree-shake unused component features
- Minimize component re-renders

#### Asset Optimization
- Lazy load images below the fold
- Provide appropriate srcset for responsive images
- Use modern image formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Implement proper alt text for accessibility
- Optimize image sizes before upload

#### General Performance
- Use reactive data appropriately - leverage Vue's reactivity system
- Avoid making large objects reactive unnecessarily (use `markRaw()` for static data)
- Use computed properties for derived state
- Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
- Debounce expensive operations
- Profile and optimize render performance
- Use `shallowRef()` for large data structures when deep reactivity isn't needed

### Accessibility Standards

- Verify return values and reactivity
- Test error handling paths

#### Best Practices
- Keep tests focused and isolated
- Use data-testid for reliable selection
- Avoid testing Vue internals
- Mock API calls and external services
- Maintain high test coverage

### Error Boundary Pattern

#### Error Boundary Implementation
- Use onErrorCaptured to catch child component errors
- Log errors to centralized error tracking
- Display user-friendly error messages
- Provide recovery mechanisms
- Prevent error propagation when handled

#### Error Logging Pattern
1. First verify `logs.error_logs` table exists
2. Check project's existing error logging patterns
3. Use existing error logging utilities
4. Follow established error tracking conventions
5. Include service and component context
6. Capture error message and stack trace
7. Add user and session information
8. Log to database error table via repository
9. Include timestamp and environment

#### Error Recovery
- Offer retry options for transient errors
- Provide fallback UI for critical errors
- Allow users to report issues
- Clear error state after recovery
- Maintain app stability
