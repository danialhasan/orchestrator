## 🚀 Key Features

- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple specialized agents simultaneously
- **Git Worktree Isolation**: Each agent works in isolated branches
- **Dependency Management**: Smart staging based on project dependencies  
- **Runtime Verification**: Integration testing between agent outputs
- **Zero Integration Failures**: Proven system with 0% integration failure rate

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/orchestrator.git
cd orchestrator

# Run setup script
./setup.sh
```

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. Open Claude Code in your project directory
2. Use `/discover` to analyze your codebase
3. Use `/spec` to create implementation specifications
4. Use `/orchestrate` to deploy multiple agents

## 🤖 Available Agents

### Discovery Agents
- `code-archaeologist` - Maps existing codebases
- `dependency-scanner` - Identifies dependencies
- `pattern-detective` - Discovers coding patterns
- `documentation-scanner` - Extracts project intent
- `test-analyzer` - Assesses test coverage
- `health-checker` - Checks compilation and runtime health

### Implementation Agents
- `backend-engineer` - Backend API development
- `frontend-engineer` - Frontend UI development
- `software-engineer` - General software development
- `qa-engineer` - Testing and quality assurance
- `security-auditor` - Security analysis and fixes
- `performance-optimizer` - Performance improvements

### Orchestration Agents
- `dependency-orchestrator` - Plans execution stages
- `verification-agent` - Validates agent outputs
- `type-contract` - Establishes type contracts
- `runtime-integration-test` - Tests actual system behavior

## 📚 Documentation

See the `docs/` directory for detailed documentation on:
- Agent orchestration patterns
