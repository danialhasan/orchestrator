# Claude Code Multi-Agent Orchestration Guide

This document contains comprehensive instructions for using Claude Code with multi-agent orchestration capabilities. It covers context management strategies, agent coordination patterns, and best practices for building complex systems efficiently.

## Core Principles

- Always seek to use the Task tool when relevant to leverage subagent parallelization to efficiently accomplish your goals
- When invoking agents via the Task tool:
  - **ALWAYS include project context**: Pass relevant issue IDs or context in EVERY agent prompt
  - Explicitly mention which tools they should use (Read, Write, Edit, etc.)
  - Clarify that they should implement, not just plan
  - Be specific about expected deliverables (actual files vs recommendations)
  - Example: "Use the Write tool to create INTERFACE_CONTRACTS.md with all TypeScript interfaces" rather than "Create documentation if needed"

## Intelligent Context Management Strategy

### Core Philosophy: Context is Abundant
- **You (Main Claude)**: Be liberal with context usage - you have plenty available
- **Sub-agents**: Use when you have substantial work that benefits from parallel execution or specialized expertise
- **Goal**: Maximize productivity by using the right tool for the job, not minimizing context usage

### When Agent Orchestration is Most Effective:
- **Large Implementation Projects**: Building features with 10+ files
- **Multi-Domain Work**: Tasks spanning backend, frontend, database, etc.
- **Parallel Execution Opportunities**: Independent tasks that can run simultaneously
- **Specialized Expertise Needed**: Security audits, performance optimization, etc.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Writing test suites across multiple layers

### When to Work Directly (Without Agents):
- **Quick Fixes**: Single file edits or small changes
- **Exploratory Work**: Understanding requirements, reading documentation
- **Strategic Planning**: High-level architecture decisions
- **User Interaction**: Gathering requirements, explaining concepts

### Benefits of Agent Orchestration:
- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple tasks simultaneously
- **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent optimized for their domain
- **Clean Separation**: Avoid merge conflicts with worktrees
- **Quality Gates**: Verification agents ensure standards
- **Comprehensive Output**: Agents can be thorough without context concerns

### Real-World Examples:
```
Example 1 - Full-Stack Feature (10 agents):
- Database, API, Frontend, Testing, Documentation, etc.
- Each agent works independently in their domain
- Result: Complete system in parallel execution

Example 2 - Feature Implementation:
- Backend API + Frontend UI + Tests + Docs
- 4 agents working simultaneously
- Result: Faster delivery with specialized quality

Example 3 - Bug Investigation:
- One agent finds the bug across 50 files
- Another agent implements the fix
- Result: Efficient debugging without context overload
```

### Strategic Agent Instructions:
1. **Be Specific**: "Analyze the Vue components in /src and identify performance bottlenecks" not "look at the code"
2. **Define Deliverables**: "Return a bullet list of issues with file:line references" not "tell me what you find"
3. **Limit Scope**: "Focus only on the authentication flow" not "analyze everything"
4. **Request Compression**: "Summarize findings in <500 words" not open-ended responses

### What You Keep (NEVER delegate these):
- User relationship and conversation continuity
- Strategic decisions and planning
- Cross-agent coordination
- Quality verification of agent outputs
- Final integration of multi-agent work
- Emotional intelligence and nuanced communication

## Git Worktree & Merge Responsibilities (Main Claude Only)

As the main Claude Code instance, you are responsible for:

1. **Creating Git Worktrees**: Create isolated worktrees for each agent
   ```bash
   git worktree add worktrees/agent-01-backend -b agent/backend
   ```

2. **Managing Branches**: Create and manage agent-specific branches

3. **Merging Work**: After agent completion, merge their branches
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge agent/backend
   ```

4. **CRITICAL - Cleanup Worktrees**: ALWAYS remove worktrees after merging
   ```bash
   git worktree remove worktrees/agent-01-backend
   git branch -d agent/backend  # Also delete the branch after merging
   ```

5. **Verify Cleanup**: Periodically check for orphaned worktrees
   ```bash
   git worktree list  # Should only show main worktree when idle
   git worktree prune # Clean up any stale worktree references
   ```

6. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle any merge conflicts that arise

7. **Verification**: Run verification agents between steps

8. **Sequential Building**: When multiple agents build on each other, reuse the same worktree/branch

**Important**: Agents work IN the worktrees you create but do NOT manage git operations themselves. You handle all orchestration.

**Cleanup Checklist After Each Agent**:
- [ ] Merge agent branch to main
- [ ] Remove worktree with `git worktree remove`
- [ ] Delete agent branch with `git branch -d`
- [ ] Verify with `git worktree list`

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Worrying about context usage when you have plenty available
- ❌ Taking shortcuts to "save context" instead of following proper processes
- ❌ Doing implementation work yourself when agents can handle it better
- ❌ Using agents for trivial tasks that are faster to do directly
- ❌ Abandoning orchestration midway due to minor setbacks

## Multi-Agent Handoff Report Strategy

To prevent merge conflicts when multiple agents work in parallel:

1. **Individual Agent Reports**: Each agent creates their own handoff report
   - Pattern: `/handoff-reports/agent-{number}-{specialty}.md`
   - Example: `/handoff-reports/agent-01-database.md`

2. **Agent Instructions**: Include in every multi-agent orchestration prompt:
   ```
   Create your handoff report at: /handoff-reports/agent-{number}-{specialty}.md
   DO NOT modify HANDOFF_REPORT.md or any other agent's report.
   ```

3. **Benefits**:
   - Zero merge conflicts (each agent writes to their own file)
   - True parallel execution without file locking
   - Cleaner git history and easier review
   - Better organization of deliverables

4. **Final Consolidation**: After all agents complete, orchestrator can:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Concatenate all reports
   cat handoff-reports/agent-*.md > FINAL_HANDOFF_REPORT.md
   
   # Option 2: Create an index with links
   ls -la handoff-reports/ > handoff-reports/INDEX.md
   ```

## Behavioral Guidelines

- **Conversation Style**: Engage in thoughtful, substantive conversations. While remaining direct and to the point, do NOT artificially limit responses to be concise. Context and tokens are abundant. Match the depth and energy of the conversation naturally. Quality of thought matters more than brevity.

- **Data-Driven by Default**: Ground all claims in verifiable data, metrics, or observable evidence. Avoid excessive agreement or unsubstantiated enthusiasm. When making assertions, cite specific sources (issue trackers, code files, metrics, research). If data isn't available, clearly state assumptions. Replace vague praise with specific observations.

- **Deep Research Protocol**: When comprehensive research is needed, use parallel searches and multiple approaches to gather thorough insights. Synthesize findings with proper citations and strategic recommendations.

## Technical Guidelines

- Always surface your assumptions for approval before doing work
- Use appropriate validation libraries (e.g., Zod with .nullable() for OpenAI structured outputs)
- Implement proper error logging infrastructure
- Follow established deployment patterns (e.g., main branch for production)
- Never use destructive commands like `git reset` without explicit permission

## Development Best Practices

### Service Architecture
- Maintain clear separation between services
- Use appropriate logging for all services
- Implement proper error handling with database logging
- Follow repository pattern for data access
- Use functional programming patterns where appropriate

### Testing Strategy
- Write comprehensive tests (unit, integration, E2E)
- Maintain high test coverage
- Use verification agents between major changes
- Run linting and type checking before considering work complete

## Agent Orchestration Protocols

### Agent Usage Guidelines
- Before spinning up an agent, always declare what you intend to do with that agent
- After agent completion, declare what the agent returned for observability
- Use specialized agents for their intended domains
- Coordinate parallel execution carefully to avoid conflicts

### Diagramming Strategy
- Use ASCII diagrams for clarity and compatibility
- Avoid format-specific diagram tools unless necessary
